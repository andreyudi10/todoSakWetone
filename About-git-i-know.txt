all about git that i know

to begin, once for all
git init

especially on new terminal, it's differ a bit than u're using in vs code
git config --global

used to make a new branch and switch to that new branch
git branch -b
git remote -v //for see which branch are you on

intialization then holy trinity of git
git clone (url)
//then open the folder do some coding
git add .
git commit -m "comment"
git push origin master
//do upload at origin(url) and master(branch)

//if you already have the folder you can do this instead
git remote add origin (url)
